Data and Analysis: 
1) Explain the design and algorithm for your Bot 4, being as specific as possible as to what your bot is actually doing. How does you bot factor in the available information to make more informed decisions about what to do next?

2) For each bot, repeatedly generate test environments and evaluate the performance of the bot, for many values
of q between 0 and 1. Graph the probability (or average frequency, rather) of the bot successfully putting out
the fire. Be sure to repeat the experiment enough times to get accurate results for each bot, and each tested
value of q.

3) When bots fail or get trapped by the fire, why do they fail? Was there a better decision they could have made that would have saved them? Why or why not? Support your conclusions.

4) Speculate on how you might construct the ideal bot. What information would it use, what information would it compute, and how?
